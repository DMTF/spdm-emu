         [--key_schedule] is key schedule algorithm. By default, HMAC_HASH is used.
         [--other_param] is other parameter support. By default, OPAQUE_FMT_1 is used.
                 Above algorithms also support multiple flags. Please use ',' for them.
                 Not all the algorithms are supported, especially SHA3, EDDSA, and SMx.
                 Please don't mix NIST algo with SMx algo.
         [--basic_mut_auth] is the basic mutual authentication policy. BASIC is used in CHALLENGE_AUTH. By default, BASIC is used.
         [--mut_auth] is the mutual authentication policy. WO_ENCAP, W_ENCAP or DIGESTS is used in KEY_EXCHANGE_RSP. By default, W_ENCAP is used.
         [--meas_sum] is the measurment summary hash type in CHALLENGE_AUTH, KEY_EXCHANGE_RSP and PSK_EXCHANGE_RSP. By default, ALL is used.
         [--meas_op] is the measurement operation in GET_MEASUREMEMT. By default, ONE_BY_ONE is used.
         [--meas_att] is the measurement attribute in GET_MEASUREMEMT. By default, HASH is used.
         [--key_upd] is the key update operation in KEY_UPDATE. By default, ALL is used. RSP will trigger encapsulated KEY_UPDATE.
         [--slot_id] is to select the peer slot ID in GET_MEASUREMENT, CHALLENGE_AUTH, KEY_EXCHANGE and FINISH. By default, 0 is used.
                 0xFF can be used to indicate provisioned certificate chain. No GET_CERTIFICATE is needed.
         [--slot_count] is to select the local slot count. By default, 3 is used. And the slot store cert chain continuously in emu.
         [--save_state] is to save the current negotiated state to a write-only file.
                 The requester and responder will save state after GET_VERSION/GET_CAPABILLITIES/NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS.
                 (negotiated state == ver|cap|hash|meas_spec|meas_hash|asym|req_asym|dhe|aead|key_schedule|other_param)
                 The responder should set CACHE capabilities, otherwise the state will not be saved.
                 The requester will clear PRESERVE_NEGOTIATED_STATE_CLEAR bit in END_SESSION to preserve, otherwise this bit is set.
                 The responder will save empty state, if the requester sets PRESERVE_NEGOTIATED_STATE_CLEAR bit in END_SESSION.
         [--load_state] is to load the negotiated state to current session from a read-only file.
                 The requester and responder will provision the state just after SPDM context is created.
                 The user need guarantee the state file is gnerated correctly.
                 The command line input - ver|cap|hash|meas_spec|meas_hash|asym|req_asym|dhe|aead|key_schedule|other_param are ignored.
                 The requester will skip GET_VERSION/GET_CAPABILLITIES/NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS.
         [--exe_mode] is used to control the execution mode. By default, it is SHUTDOWN.
                 SHUTDOWN means the requester asks the responder to stop.
                 CONTINUE means the requester asks the responder to preserve the current SPDM context.
         [--exe_conn] is used to control the SPDM connection. By default, it is DIGEST,CERT,CHAL,MEAS.
                 VER_ONLY means REQUESTER does not send GET_CAPABILITIES/NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS. It is used for quick symmetric authentication with PSK.
                 DIGEST means send GET_DIGESTS command.
                 CERT means send GET_CERTIFICATE command.
                 CHAL means send CHALLENGE command.
                 MEAS means send GET_MEASUREMENT command.
         [--exe_session] is used to control the SPDM session. By default, it is KEY_EX,PSK,KEY_UPDATE,HEARTBEAT,MEAS.
                 KEY_EX means to setup KEY_EXCHANGE session.
                 PSK means to setup PSK_EXCHANGE session.
                 NO_END means to not send END_SESSION.
                 KEY_UPDATE means to send KEY_UPDATE in session.
                 HEARTBEAT means to send HEARTBEAT in session.
                 MEAS means send GET_MEASUREMENT command in session.
         [--pcap] is used to generate PCAP dump file for offline analysis.

   Take spdm_requester_emu or spdm_responder_emu as an example, a user may use `spdm_requester_emu --pcap SpdmRequester.pcap > SpdmRequester.log` or `spdm_responder_emu --pcap SpdmResponder.pcap > SpdmResponder.log` to get the PCAP file and the log file.

   To test PCI_DOE, a user may use `spdm_requester_emu --trans PCI_DOE --pcap SpdmRequester.pcap > SpdmRequester.log` or `spdm_responder_emu  --trans PCI_DOE --pcap SpdmResponder.pcap > SpdmResponder.log` to get the PCAP file and the log file.

   [spdm_dump](https://github.com/DMTF/spdm-dump/blob/main/doc/spdm_dump.md) tool can be used to parse the pcap file for offline analysis.

   NOTE: Not all combination is supported. Please file issue or submit patch for them if you find something is not expected.
